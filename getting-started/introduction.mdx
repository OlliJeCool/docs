### Technologies utilized
Decode API leverages a robust stack of technologies to deliver seamless functionality within the ecosystem:

- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/): As the foundation of our API, NestJS provides a powerful and scalable framework for building server-side applications with TypeScript. Its modular architecture and dependency injection make development efficient and maintainable.

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/): Utilizing GraphQL as our query language for APIs enables efficient data fetching and precise querying. By allowing our client to request only the data it needs, GraphQL optimizes network usage and enhances performance.

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started): Secure authentication and authorization are ensured through integration with Auth0. With features such as authentication, single sign-on, and user management, Auth0 provides a robust solution for identity management within the Decode Fashion platform.

- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs): Manages database operations, providing a type-safe and efficient interface for working with PostgreSQL databases, ensuring robust and scalable data management.

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/): Serves as the database management system for storing and retrieving data within the Decode Fashion platform, offering reliability, scalability, and robust data integrity.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/): Enables containerization of applications, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency across different environments for the Decode Fashion platform.

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started): Facilitates unit testing for ensuring code reliability and functionality within the Decode Fashion platform, allowing for comprehensive testing of individual components and modules.
