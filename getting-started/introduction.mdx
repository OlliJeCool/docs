### Seamless Integration

### Technologies utilized
Decode API leverages a robust stack of technologies to deliver seamless functionality within the ecosystem:

- [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/): As the foundation of our API, NestJS provides a powerful and scalable framework for building server-side applications with TypeScript. Its modular architecture and dependency injection make development efficient and maintainable.

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/): Utilizing GraphQL as our query language for APIs enables efficient data fetching and precise querying. By allowing our client to request only the data it needs, GraphQL optimizes network usage and enhances performance.

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started): Secure authentication and authorization are ensured through integration with Auth0. With features such as authentication, single sign-on (SSO), and user management, Auth0 provides a robust solution for identity management within the Decode Fashion platform.
